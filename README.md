# LiveActivitiesDemo

## How to run the application
Just clone the application and run the FoodDeliveryTest target.\n
Once the application is installed you can start the activity and check its UI by checking your notification.\n
By changing the states of picket the activity can be updated which in turn will update the Live activity and there is a 2 seconds delay before the activity updates just for demo purposes. And the same happens when removing the activity
